# What it is

Composer project `scrapyard-io/scrapyard-io` — the application skeleton for ScrapyardIO framework **0.7.x**.[^composer]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `scrapyard-io/scrapyard-io` |
| Type | `project` |
| PHP | `^8.4\|^8.5\|^8.6` |
| Framework | `scrapyard-io/framework` `^0.7.0` |
| REPL | `scrapyard-io/wrench` `^0.7.0` |
| App namespace | `App\` → `app/` |

This tree is for building apps — not the Fabricate core. Core code lives in [`scrapyard-io/framework`](https://github.com/ScrapyardIO/framework); docs live on the [ScrapyardIO website](https://scrapyard-io.projectsaturnstudios.com/docs).[^readme]

This checkout also ships **Tetriminos** (`./runner tetris [metal|cuda|open-gl|vulkan|sdl3]`). Same tree on Mac and Jetson — [Dual-host](../concepts/dual-host.md). VSync / Target FPS contract: [Tetriminos](../concepts/tetris-app.md).

# `.okf` in create-project vs deploy

Unlike library packages (`framework`, `wrench`), this skeleton does **not** mark `/.okf` as `export-ignore`.[^gitattributes] Agents and humans keep the knowledge bundle when creating a project.

When deploying the app to a target (for example an SBC), add:

```gitattributes
/.okf export-ignore
```

so deploy archives omit the knowledge bundle. Details are in the project README.[^readme]

# What belongs elsewhere

- Fabricate components, dependency direction, MagicAliases → `scrapyard-io/framework` OKF
- Wrench REPL provider / casters → `scrapyard-io/wrench` OKF
- Chip/GPIO drivers → companion packages
